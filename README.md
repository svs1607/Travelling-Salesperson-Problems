# Travelling-Salesperson-Problems

This repository contains various projects based off of the famous Travelling Salesperson Problem. 

The file `Travelling Salesperson - Nearest Neighbours` contains an algorithm created using `numpy` to attempt to solve the TSP using the Nearest Neighbours Algorithm. The function was then used to solve the problem for the 20 largest Canadian cities, for which the data can be found in the file `newdata.csv`.

The next file `Travelling Salesperson Problem Animation` builds off of the algorithm created in the previous file and creates an animation of the solutions generated by the algorithm using `matplotlib`.

The last file `Network X TSP Exploration` uses the package Network X to solve the Travelling Salesperson Problem, and creates a visual using the package. The data for this was pulled off of the \href{http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/}{TSPLIB Website} and is saved in the file `TSPlib.csv`.

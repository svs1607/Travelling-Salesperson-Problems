# Travelling-Salesperson-Problems

This repository contains projects based off of the famous Travelling Salesperson Problem. 

The first project creates a solution to the problem using the Nearest Neighbours Algorithm in Python, and simulates a real world example using the 20 largest Canadian cities. 

The animation builds off of the Nearest Neighbour Algorithm and draws the different possible solutions and paths to potential problems using `matplotlib`.
